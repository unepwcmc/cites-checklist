        <h2><a id="cites-checklist">CITES Checklist</a></h2>
        <p>
        The <span class="bold">Checklist of CITES Species</span> provides the official list of CITES-listed species (scientific names)
        and their associated scientific synonyms; common names in English, French and Spanish (where available) and the CITES Appendix
        in which they are currently listed (see <a href="https://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/document/E-Res-12-11-R18.pdf">Resolution 12.11 (Rev CoP18)</a>).
        Information on historical Appendix listings, reservations and level of listing (e.g. if a whole family or order is listed), as well as identification materials sourced from the CITES Identification Manual and the CITES Virtual College, are also available through this website.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="web-display">Web display &#38; data downloads</a></h2>
        <p>
        Users can search for and view CITES listing information for CITES-listed species online. The scientific name, higher taxonomy,
        scientific synonyms, common names, distribution, current listing and history of listings (in the form of timelines) are all visible
        through the web display, and links are provided for identification materials relevant to each taxon. Filters applied to the search and the Advanced options (see below) also affect the data displayed online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three distinct outputs are available for download through this website:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="bold italic">Index of CITES species:</span> an alphabetical list of all animal and plant taxa currently included in
            the CITES Appendices; and </li>
          <li><span class="bold italic">History of CITES listings:</span> a historical record of all CITES listings since 1975, including all
          reservations and annotations ever made; and</li>
          <li><span class="bold italic">Identification materials:</span> a compilation of identification materials for CITES-listed taxa.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The first two outputs are available in three different formats: PDF, csv (for use in Excel) and JSON format (for use by web developers). Downloads of identification materials from the CITES Identification Manual are available as PDFs.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Note on csv files:</span> Users can download the official list of CITES-listed species in csv files. These use commas as separators;
        this might conflict the regional settings of some computer systems.</p>

        <p>
          The full <span class="italic">Index of CITES species</span> and <span class="italic">History of CITES listings</span>, as well as all seven volumes of the <span class="italic"></span>CITES Identification Manual</span>, are always available
          on the right hand side of the website under <strong>&#8220;Featured&#8221; </strong>. In the case of the <span class="italic">Index of CITES species</span>,
          the full version of this can also be downloaded through the red &#8220;Download&#8221; button if no filters are selected.
          Users also have the flexibility to produce tailored versions of the <span class="italic">Index of
          CITES species</span> outputs and the <span class="italic">CITES Identification Manual</span> depending on their needs. Most notably, users can filter by name (including higher taxa), CITES Appendix and
          country/territory/region of occurrence (&#8220;All locations&#8221;).
          These filters will then filter the data displayed on the website, as well as the data downloaded through the red &#8220;Download&#8221; button,
          so that users can view and download smaller subsets of data.
        </p> 
        <p>
        <span class="bold">Note</span>: Filters for country/territory/region of occurrence include all taxa associated with that geographic entity, including
        taxa that are recorded as extinct, introduced or re-introduced in that area. Full details of these distribution
        attributes are available within the Excel-compatible csv downloads. Filters do not apply to the <span class="italic">History of CITES listings</span>
        outputs, which are only available in full through the &#8220;History of listing&#8221; link under <strong>&#8220;Featured&#8221; </strong>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Browser compatibility</h3>
        <p>This site is optimised for Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome. The site may not display properly in older browsers.</p>

        <h2><a id="advanced-options">Advanced options:</a></h2>
        <p>
          Under &#8220;Advanced options&#8221; users are able to tailor the web display and Checklist outputs as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <span class="bold">Common names:</span> By de-selecting &#8216;EN&#8217;, &#8216;ES&#8217;, and &#8216;FR&#8217;, this will remove the English, Spanish and
          French common names on both the web display and within the Index downloads accessible through the red &#8220;Download&#8221; button;
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Online view:</span> Selecting &#8220;Alphabetical&#8221; or &#8216;Taxonomic&#8217; affects the way the taxonomic entities are sorted on the
            web view only. The PDF and csv outputs will always be   sorted alphabetically. &#8220;Appendix&#8221; view, when selected, mirrors the display of the CITES Appendices,
            showing taxa at the level at which they are listed in taxonomic   order. For instance, &#8220;Felidae spp.&#8221; will be included because there is a family
            listing that applies, but species within Felidae that are included in the family level listing would not appear in the web display. NB: species included within
            a higher level listing would not be searchable if this format is selected. 
          </li>
          <li>
          <span class="bold">Display:</span> These options affect the information displayed for each taxon on the website.
          </li>
          
            <ul>
              <li> 
                <span class="bold">Synonyms:</span> When ticked, scientific synonyms (where available) will be shown in the web display (and within the PDF and csv outputs for the
                <span class="italic">Index of CITES species</span>). Unticking this will remove the synonyms from the web display and the tailored downloads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Author&#8217;s name:</span> When ticked, the author citations for taxa will be shown in the web display (and within the PDF and csv outputs).
                Unticking this will remove the author citation from the web display and the tailored downloads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">History of listing:</span> When ticked, the history of listing (displayed online as a timeline) will expand for all taxa on the page.
                This does not impact the downloads.
              </li>
            </ul>
          
        </ul>
        <h2><a id="timelines">Timelines:</a></h2>
        <p>
          Timelines provide a visual display of the history of CITES listings on the web display. They can be viewed by clicking <strong>&#8220;Show More&#8221;</strong> on a species/higher taxon entry. Symbols on the timelines indicate the inclusion of a taxon in an
          Appendix (&#8216;+&#8217;), the removal/deletion of a taxa from an Appendix (&#8216;-&#8217;), and a change to an annotation relevant to the Appendix listing
          (&#8216;A&#8217;). For timelines displaying reservation information, &#8216;R&#8217; indicates a reservation that was entered by a Party and 'W'
          indicates that the Party has withdrawn the reservation. The exact date of the event can be viewed by hovering over the symbols; more details on the listings,
          reservations or any changes to annotations can be viewed by clicking on the symbols associated with the timeline event. The Appendix symbol representing the
          current listing (displayed to the right of the scientific name) is also clickable to view additional listing information or annotations that may apply.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="identification">Identification materials:</a></h2>
        <p>
          Identification materials, where available, can be viewed by clicking <strong>&#8220;Show More&#8221;</strong> on a species/higher taxon entry. Materials have been collated from two sources: the CITES Identification Manual and the CITES Virtual College. The CITES Identification Manual is a collection of data sheets designed to help identify various species of fauna and flora with drawings, photographs, maps and concise descriptions. The sheets were published over a 29 year period, from 1980–2009. The CITES Virtual College hosts a collection of identification resources produced by CITES Parties, the CITES Secretariat, and non-governmental organisations, and includes websites, apps, and downloadable guides. The contents of both sources are provided as they were originally published, and, as such, no warranty of any kind is given as to the completeness or accuracy of the content. Identification materials may not available for some species, and CITES Identification Manual materials may be absent particularly for species listed in the CITES Appendices after 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users should note that the CITES listing and taxonomy of taxa described in the materials available may have changed since the materials were first published. For current CITES nomenclature and listing information, please refer to the main Checklist of CITES Species site and dedicated downloads for listings/names.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note on languages:</strong>The CITES Identification Manual contains materials available in the three working languages of the Convention (English, French and Spanish), but materials in French and Spanish are available for fewer taxa. Materials are provided in the language specified where possible, but where materials are not available in French and Spanish, they are instead provided in English. 
        </p>

        <h2><a id="standard-nomenclature">Standard nomenclatural references used</a></h2>
        <p>Taxonomic names that have been officially adopted by the Conference of the Parties [see the list of standard nomenclatural references in
          <a href="https://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/document/E-Res-12-11-R18.pdf">Resolution Conf. 12.11 (Rev. CoP18)]</a> appear in boldface in the <span class="italic">Checklist</span>,
          e.g. <span class="bold italic">Acinonyx jubatus</span> (the cheetah). This is the case for most taxa. In some cases, nevertheless, a standard nomenclatural reference
          for the constituent species of a higher taxon has not yet been adopted. In such instances, a reference identified by UNEP-WCMC has been used. The names of these taxa
          are not in boldface, e.g. <span class="italic">Tridacna maxima</span> (or any Tridacnidae species), as in previous printed versions of the <span class="italic">Checklist</span>.
        </p>
